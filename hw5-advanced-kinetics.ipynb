    "\n",
    "The [Belousov-Zhabotinsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belousov%E2%80%93Zhabotinsky_reaction) reaction is a chemical oscillator driven by competing auto-catalytic processes. You can see a demonstration of the reaction [here](https://youtu.be/LL3kVtc-4vY?t=494). The overall reaction has the following form:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 3\\text{CH}_2(\\text{CO}_2\\text{H})_2 + 4 \\text{BrO}^−_3 → 4 \\text{Br}^− + 9 \\text{CO}_2 + 6 \\text{H}_2\\text{O} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Although the exact mechanism for this reaction is very complex and not fully understood, several simple mechanism models have been proposed. In this assingment, you will run a reaction kinetics simulation with the \"Oregonator\" model described in the following paper:\n",

    "\n",
    "- Assume all reactions are irreversible\n",
    "- Assume the reaction kinetics are described by equations $(\\text{Ia-Ic})$ and use the rate constants in equations $(\\text{IIa-IIf})$\n",
    "- Use the `solve_ivp` function with the `method='Radau'` option (see [documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) for more information).\n",
    "- Try plotting the concentrations of all three species over time a timespan of 600 seconds\n",
    "- Assume constant $[\\text{A}] = [\\text{B}] = 0.06\\ \\text{M}$, and use the following initial conditions:\n",

In this simulation, the oscillation continues indefinitely; however, in practice the reaction eventually reaches equilibrium. Which assumption in our simulation causes the reaction to continue indefinitely, and how could you update the simulation to account for this?"
