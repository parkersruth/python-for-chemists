## Getting Started with Jupyter Notebooks

Python programming can be a powerful tool for chemists. The Python language itself specifies the basic programming syntax and a limited [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). To add more powerful functionality to the basic language, we can import additional packages, which contain code written by other programmers.

Anaconda is a distribution of the Python language, a large number of helpful packages, and some applications that help you write Python code, called integrated development environments (IDEs).

1. Download the latest version of the Anaconda distribution of Python from [here](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)
(we recommend downloading Python 3, not Python 2).
2. Run the installer (.exe on Windows or .dmg on MacOS); you can accept all of the default installation settings.
3. Once installation is complete, you should be able to launch an application called the "Anaconda Navigator".
4. From the Anaconda Navigator, launch the JupyterLab application (you can 
5. Navigate the directory to find and open the `hw-0-getting-started.ipynb` file.
6. Follow the instructions in the file to get started.
