    "To simulate a physical system, we need to describe how that system changes over time as a function of its current state. This description often takes the form of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Although solving ODEs analytically is sometimes difficult or impossible, their solutions can be approximated by numerically integrating them over time, given some initial conditions. Python provides a collection of powerful general-purpose numeral integration tools that can be used for solving an initial value problem (IVP) of this kind. We will be using the `solve_ivp` function for this purpose. The `solve_ivp` function takes three inputs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An arbitrary function describing the derivative of the variable(s)\n",
    "2. A time span on which to compute the solution to the IVP\n",
    "3. The initial conditions at the beginning of the time span\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a bundle of information to us. In particular it gives us the following:\n",

    "1. An array of times within the range specified in the input\n",
